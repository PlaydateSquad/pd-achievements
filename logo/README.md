# Playdate Achievements Logo Guidelines

You may use the Playdate Achievements logo to provide attribution (such as in your gameâ€™s credits), to promote support for the standard on your website, or within UI elements (such as your achievements viewer or its menu item/button). This repo contains versions of the logo in a variety of colors, sizes, and formats for your use. Please observe the guidelines laid out below when displaying the Playdate Achievements logo.

## ðŸŸ¨ Displaying the Logo On the Playdate Screen

In addition to the general guidelines below, please adhere to these suggestions when displaying the logo on the Playdate screen:

- Always use one of the outlined logo variations (including the dithered versions designed specifically for the device screen). Prefer [white outlined](./white/outlined) or [light dithered](./dithered/light) on black or dark backgrounds; prefer [black outlined](./black/outlined) or [dark dithered](./dithered/dark) on white or light backgrounds.
- Always use one of the provided logo sizes (`xsmall` â€“ `xlarge`) to preserve its crisp chunky pixels. _Do not scale_ the logo to intermediate sizes.
- Use the `small` size or larger when providing attribution, such as in your gameâ€™s credits. The `xsmall` size may be used in UI contexts, such as in the header of an achievements view, accompanying trophy counts in a list, or as a button icon.
- Never tilt or rotate the logo for display on the Playdate screen.
- Never use a shadow when displaying the logo on the Playdate screen.

## General Usage Guidelines

### Margin

Leave a minimum 5% margin at the edge of any layout containing the logo to ensure it has adequate room to breathe.

> [!TIP]
> ðŸŸ¨ This translates to a recommended 20px minimum margin when displaying the logo on the Playdate screen.

### Clear Space

Leave a minimum space around all sides of the logo equivalent to 3 of its chunky pixelsâ€”also the width its handles extend from the screen.

> [!TIP]
> ðŸŸ¨ The recommended clear spaces for the provided on-device logo sizes are:
>
> - `xsmall`: 6px
> - `small`: 12px
> - `medium`: 18px
> - `large`: 24px
> - `xlarge`: 30px

### Background

Place the logo on a solid (or consistently dithered) background. Avoid placing the logo on busy backgrounds, such as photographic content.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸŸ¨ Always use an outlined logo variant when displaying on the playdate screen to ensure ample background separation.

### Size & Scaling

Never squash, stretch, or otherwise scale the logo disproportionately. Always scale the logo proportionally to preserve the integrity of its chunky square pixels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸŸ¨ Always use one of the provided icon sizes when displaying the logo on the Playdate screen; _do not scale_ to intermediate sizes for display on device.

### Tilt & Rotation

Do not rotate the logo. The sole exception to this rule is a standard 9Â° counter-clockwise tilt which may be applied to any variation in non-device contexts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸŸ¨ Never tilt or rotate the logo when displaying on the Playdate screen.

### Shadow

A shadow may be used for non-device applications. A full color variant with a shadow is provided for use. When using any other variant with a shadow, adhere to these shadow properties rounded to the nearest integer value:

- **X offset:** -1% width
- **Y offset:** 10% height
- **Blur:** 0
- **Color:** black
- **Opacity:** 25%

Do not use a shadow with blur. The shadow should appear crisp, preserving the pixelated aesthetic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸŸ¨ Never use a shadow when displaying the logo on the Playdate screen.
