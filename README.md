# pd-achievements
Cross-game achievement standard for the Playdate console.

Useful for configuring, granting, and revoking in-game achievements. Comes with some limited achievement viewing support out-of-the-box, but developers are encouraged to create their own 3rd party clients for viewing achievements on-device.

WARNING: This standard is still in development. Forward-compatibility is not yet guaranteed.

[The specification draft can be seen here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15iYMDmXdnDbOhoskyvfJsypu7Ls538R0kJNVYKDFx44/edit#heading=h.387me39epg7l)

## Achievement Viewers
`pd-achievements` aims to create a standard data format to manage game achievements. While it provides some limited in-game achievement browsing functions, developers are encouraged to create their own achievement clients that read the data saved to `/Shared`.
